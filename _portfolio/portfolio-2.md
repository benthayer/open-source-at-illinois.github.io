We started building a website using the MEANS stack and now we want you all to join us.
No prior skills are necessary, as we will teach you everything you need to know.
If you want something awesome to put on your resume, this would be a great start.
You will have some attractive skills to show off and an awesome project to talk with recruiters about.
This project will likely resume in early November, so be sure to drop by and learn more.
